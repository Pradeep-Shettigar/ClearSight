# 🧠 ClearSight – Brain Tumor Detection

## 📌 Overview

ClearSight is a deep learning–based application designed to detect and visualize brain tumors from MRI images.
It uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) along with Grad-CAM visualization to highlight important regions influencing the model’s predictions.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Upload MRI images for analysis
* Predict tumor presence using a trained model
* Visualize model attention using heatmaps (Grad-CAM)
* Simple and interactive interface built with Streamlit

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python
* PyTorch
* Streamlit
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* Pillow
